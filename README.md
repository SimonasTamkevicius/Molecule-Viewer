# Molecule-Viewer
These are all of the files for a molecule viewer project where you can add/remove elements, upload sdf files of molecules, and view and rotate the molecules on a web page.

Please feel free to run the code with: python3 server.py 57172 and open localhost:57172/home.html in your browser.


This code is a part of a school project done at the University of Guelph, and the idea for the project is from Stefan C. Kremer.
